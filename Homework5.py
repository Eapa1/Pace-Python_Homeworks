#Write a program that generates a seven random numbers, each in a range of 0 to
#9, and assign each number to a list element.

print (List[0])
print (List[1])
print (List[2])
print (List[3])
print (List[4])
print (List[5])
print (List[6])

#a) Find the lowest number in the list, print it.
Lowest=(min(List))
print('lowest number in this list is:' , Lowest)

#b) Find the highest number in the list, print it.
Highest=(max(List))
print ('highest number in this list is:', Highest)

#c) Find the total of the numbers in the list, print it
def sum(List):
    total = 0
    for x in List:
        total += x
    return total

#d) Find the average of the numbers, print it.
Average = (sum(List)/len(List))
print('The average of this numbers:', Average)
##Then write another loop that displays the contents of the list
for i in List:
    print(i,end = ' ,')
